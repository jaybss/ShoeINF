Since its debut in 1977, this low-top silhouette has established itself as an icon in the skate, music, and fashion scenes. From 90s street skaters and punks to current hip hop and fashion legends, the Old Skool has consistently been the go-to shoe for creatives who do things their own way.</p><br><h2>Color Style:</h2><br><p class="color">-White/Black<br>-Design Your Own</p><br><h5>If you want to buy this Item Just go to:</h5><a href="https://www.vansonlinephilippines1.com/"><p>Vans Philippines</p></a></td>
